# ClifFred
Barebones Python package for lightweight, portable, efficient geometric 
algebra engine, providing basic operations in degenerate Clifford algebra 
Cl(p,q,r)  aka  |R^p,q,r , together with associated documentation and 
sample applications.   

Version 1.2 introduces some extra functions, tinkers with specifications 
which may necessitate occasional changes to existing programs, and attempts 
to facilitate comparisons between competing packages via wrappers. 
It is intended to provide wrappers for further packages in future; 
although meaningful comparisons are hindered by their divergent design 
targets and specification of subsidiary operators.
