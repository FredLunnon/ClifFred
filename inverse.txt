        The Multiplicative Inverse in Clifford Algebras 
        ----------------------------------------------- 

  The Python GA package  <clifford>  implements an uncommon operation: 
Clifford division, essentially the inverse of a general multor (when such 
exists).  Although the program itself seems to work correctly, current 
documentation claims that left-inverse and right-inverse are distinct; 
and moreover introduces five different identifiers for just two separate 
functions.  

  A casual trial suggests that --- on the contrary --- all produce essentially 
identical results, and just a single function is required.  However, proving 
that the inverse is actually unique and two-sided is not straightforward; 
so I am taking the opportunity to discuss this topic, which is evidently 
not widely understood.  

  The obscurity is understandable, since division at present lacks practical 
application, so its pursuit is at present of purely theoretical interest --- 
as far as I know, though I should be happy to be contradicted!  Geometrical 
applications are concerned with versors or numerical approximations to them, 
for which the inverse equals simply the reversion (adjoint) divided by the 
magnitude; it exists just for magnitude nonzero, and can straightforwardly 
be proved unique and two-sided. 

  Further insight unfortunately demands stepping outside the GA framework, 
to involve the matrix representation credited to Atiyah-Bott-Shapiro, 
and discussed subsequently by many authors at many levels: see eg.

  The gist of this remarkable construction is that every nondegenerate 
algebra  Cl(p,q)  with real components is isomorphic to square matrices (or 
their doubles), with components either real, complex or quaternion, and order  
m ~ 2^(n/2)  approx. where  n = p+q .  For example when  q = p , algebra 
Cl(p,p)  is equivalent to real matrices of order  m = 2^p , addition and 
multiplication corresponding.  

  But matrices have another life, representing linear transformations of a 
vector space (in dimension  m >> n  now), matrix product corresponding to 
composition of transformations.  From this it follows that they constitute a 
_group_ under multiplication: in particular just when the determinant is 
nonzero, the matrix inverse exists, is two-sided and unique --- because both 
matrix and inverse represent the same bijection between vectors, albeit in 
opposite directions! 

  Equivalently, the Clifford inverse exists, and is two-sided and unique, 
just when its matrix determinant is nonzero; it could in principle be computed 
via matrix inversion combined with conversion between Clifford algebra and 
matrix representation.  However a more brute-force approach is in practice 
much simpler (and probably just as effective): express GA equation  X Y = 1  
as linear simultaneous equations in  2^n  unknown components of  Y  with  X  
given, then solve numerically yielding GA inverse  Y  of  X .  

  Matrix null space and SVD could be employed in a similar fashion to compute 
co-divisors of zero for a multor without inverse.  The upshot is that for any 
X  there exists some  Y <> 0  such that  X Y = c , a scalar which may further 
be restricted to  {1, 0} ; if  c <> 0  then  Y  is unique, if  c = 0  then  X  
is a divisor of zero and  Y  can be chosen arbitrarily within the null space. 

  Note that there is in general no alternative to computing a determinant for 
establishing invertibility: nonzero magnitude does not guarantee invertibility, 
nor does zero magnitude preclude it.  Counter-examples in  Cl(1,1)  are 

    e e = 1 ;  ||1 + e|| = 2 ;  (1 + e)(1 - e)/2 = 0 . 
    f f = -1 ;  ||1 + f|| = 0 ;  (1 + f)(1 - f)/2 = 1 . 

  Degenerate algebras present an extra obstruction to proving two-sidedness 
(though not to actually computing the inverse) since faithful representations 
no longer exist.  This awkward fact is a consequence of an ideal-theory notion, 
the _Jacobson radical_, which is trivial in a full matrix algebra (or in its 
double?), but nontrivial in a degenerate GA. 

  Instead  Cl(p,q,r)  is isomorphically embedded within larger non-degenerate  
Cl(p+r,q+r) , via mapping each isotropic generator to the sum of a new pair 
with opposite signatures thus:  

    e e = 0 ,  f' f' = +1 ,  g' g' = -1 ;  e <-> f' + g' . 

Now we argue that  X Y = c , where  c  has the same value in both algebras; 
if  c = 0  then  X  is noninvertible in both; if  c = 1  then  X  has a unique 
two-sided inverse in the new algebra, hence also in the old via isomorphism.

  Finally, for particular  Cl(p,q,r)  in low dimension  n = p+q+r  it is 
feasible to take advantage of the structure of equations  X Y = c  to write 
down explicit a symbolic solution for  Y  in terms of  X , avoiding the 
necessity for cumbersome numerical solving: however manipulating the result 
into compact form convenient for computation is nontrivial.  See discussions at 
    http://www.euclideanspace.com/maths/algebra/clifford/algebra/functions/inverse/manfred.htm 
    http://www.iancgbell.clara.net/maths/geoalg.htm 

  In particular for nonzero multor  X  in Cl(p,q,r)  with rank  n = p+q+r <= 4 , 
the determinant (proportional to)  c  and cofactor  Y  with  X Y = Y X = c  are 
given by 
    c  :=  < X X+ >_0 ;  
    Y  :=  X+  if  X X+ = c  (nearly);  
    Y  :=  (X+) (2 c - X X+)  otherwise;  
where  X+  denotes reversion; the inverse by  1/X = Y/c  if  c <> 0 .  
Tedious justification proceeds in two stages: in chosen algebra of rank 4 , 
given arbitrary  X , set  Z = X X+  and show  <Z>_2 = <Z>_3 = 0 ; then given 
arbitrary  Z  with  <Z>_2 = <Z>_3 = 0 , set  W = Z (2 <Z>_0 - Z)  and show  W  
scalar. [ A program verifying this symbolically for all  15  signatures is 
included in file  GA_scripts.py ; though with a little more care, all cases 
can in fact be deduced from  Cl(4)  alone. ]
